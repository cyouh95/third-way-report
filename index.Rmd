## Introduction

Socioeconomic and racial inequality in access to public research universities is a growing concern for scholars and policy advocates [@RN4409].

## Background

#### Enrollment Management by Public Research Universities

While policy debates about access to higher education often focus on student behavior, universities are purposeful about which students they pursue and expend substantial resources crafting their class. Understanding the relationship between university enrollment behaviors and access inequality requires a basic understanding of the "enrollment management" industry. 

Enrollment management (EM) is a profession that integrates techniques from marketing and economics in order to "influence the characteristics and the size of enrolled student bodies" [@RN2771, p. xiv]. EM is also a university administrative structure (e.g., "The Office of Enrollment Management") that coordinates the activities of offices responsible for admissions, financial aid, marketing, and recruiting. 

CUT PARAGRAPH ON EM INDUSTRY; ADD PARAGRAPHS ON IRON TRIANGLE AND THE CAUSES/CONSEQUENCES OF NONRES ENROLLMENT GROWTH BY PUBLIC RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES

The broader enrollment management industry consists of professionals working within universities (e.g., admissions counselors), the associations enrollment management professionals belong to (e.g., National Association for College Admission Counseling), and the marketing/enrollment management consultancies universities hire (e.g., Hobsons, Ruffalo Noel Levitz).

#### The Enrollment Funnel

`r fig_nums('funnel_alt', display='cite')` depicts the "enrollment funnel," a conceptual tool the EM industry uses to describe stages in student recruitment in order to inform targeted recruiting interventions. The vast majority of research on enrollment management focuses on the final stages of the enrollment funnel, specifically which applicants are admitted [e.g., @RN3536; @RN3544; @RN3523; @RN4131] and the use of financial aid "leveraging" to convert admits to enrollees [e.g., @RN2241; @RN3564; @RN1948]. By contrast, the enrollment management industry expends substantial resources on earlier stages in the funnel.  "Prospects" are "all the potential students you would want to attract to your institution" [@RN4322]. "Inquiries" are prospects that contact the university, including those who respond to university solicitations (e.g., email, brochure) and those who reach out on their own (e.g., sending SAT/ACT scores to a university, completing a form on the admissions website).

Figure~\ref{fig:emfunnel} depicts the ``enrollment funnel,'' a conceptual tool the EM industry uses to describe stages in student recruitment in order to inform targeted recruiting interventions.  While scholarship and policy debate about college access focuses on the final stages of the enrollment funnel -- when applicants are admitted \citep[e.g., ][]{RN3536} and financial aid ``leveraging'' is used to convert admits to enrollees \citep[e.g., ][]{RN1948} -- the EM industry expends substantial resources on earlier stages of the funnel.  ``Prospects'' are ``all the potential students you would want to attract to your institution'' \citep{RN4322}. ``Inquiries'' are prospects that contact the university. These include inquiries who respond to initial solicitation by the universities (e.g., email, brochure) and unsolicited inquiries who reach out on their own (e.g., sending SAT/ACT scores to the university, completing a form on the university admissions website).  Most universities hire EM consulting firms, which utilize sophisticated, data-intensive methodologies, to help universities identify prospects, solicit inquiries, convert prospects and inquiries into applicants, etc. For example, from 2010 to 2018 the University of Alabama paid \$4.4 million to the EM consulting firm Hobsons \citep{RN4035} (2018 CPI).
```

Universities identify prospects primarily by purchasing "student lists" from College Board and ACT. For example, from 2010 to 2018, the University of Alabama paid \$1.9 million to College Board and \$349k to ACT, Inc [@RN4035]. Student lists contain contact details and background information (demographic, socioeconomic, and academic) about individual prospects. Universities control which prospects are included in the list by selecting on criteria such as zip code, race, and academic achievement. @RN4314 found that the median public university purchases about 64,000 names. 

Once identified, prospects are targeted with recruiting interventions aimed at soliciting inquiries and applications [@RN4323; @RN4402]. Face-to-face interventions include off-campus visits by universities admissions representatives (e.g., to a local high school) and on-campus visits by prospects. Non face-to-face interventions include email, mail (e.g., postcards, brochures), and texts.  Additionally, universities utilize paid advertising (e.g., pay-per-click ads from Google, cookie-driven ads that target prospects who visit your website) and social media (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, YouTube) as a means of generating inquiries and creating positive "buzz" amongst prospects. Given the the rise in "stealth applicants" who do not inquire before applying [@RN4411], social media enables universities to tell their story to prospects who do not contact the university and do not wish to be contacted.

The "data science" revolution in market research has given birth to a niche industry of higher education enrollment management/marketing consulting firms. These firms help universities identify prospects (e.g., which criteria to select when purchasing student lists) and decide which prospects should receive which recruiting interventions.  For example, from 2010 to 2018 the University of Alabama paid \$4.4 million to the EM consulting firm Hobsons [@RN4035] (2018 CPI). The consultancies integrate university-owned data (e.g., historical data on applicants, IP addresses that visit the university website), publicly available data, and proprietary data. As an example of proprietary data, one enrollment management consultantancy told us they know the houshold income, house value, and detailed expenditures (e.g., annual expenditure on hockey equipment) of every household in the US. Firms make recommendations by applying these data sources to analytic tools that predict application and enrollment probabilities for each prospect and also predict the effect of recruiting interventions on these probabilities.

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}


Universities hire these firms to make recommendations about how to identify prospects (e.g., search criteria for student list purchases) and about which prospects should receive which recruiting interventions.
Following the "data science" revolution in market research, 

In higher education, the most common application of data-science is marketing.  Search engines used by prospective students (e.g., Parchment, Niche) sell data on “prospects” to for-profit enrollment management firms (e.g., Hobsons, Chegg) that integrate multiple data sources (e.g., test scores, geographic location) to help universities identify and recruit desirable prospects.  

Enrollment management firms (e.g., Hobsons) offer market segmentation software to help colleges identify desirable prospects.  
Universities increasingly pay marketing firms for software that uses data-science methods to identify and recruit prospects.

Additionally, free college search engines (e.g., Niche, Parchment) sell data entered
by prospective students to “data science” marketing firms (e.g., Chegg, Hobsons). Universities hire
these marketing firms to identify prospects and to decide which prospects should be targeted with
which interventions, based on analytic tools that predict application and enrollment probabilities
for each prospect.

Given our research focus on off-campus recruiting, what do we know about the role of off-campus visits in student recruitment? In the admissions world, "travel season" refers to the mad dash between Labor Day and Thanksgiving when admissions officers host hotel receptions, college fairs, and visit high schools across the country [@RN3519].  @RN4402 found that public universities spent 18% of their marketing and recruiting budget on "travel to high schools and college fairs," compared to 15% for on-campus visits and 14% for student list purchases. ^[Only "traditional advertising" (e.g., billboards, newspapers, magazines, TV, radio) accounted for a higher percentage (24%)].  @RN3519, who analyzed off-campus recruiting efforts at a selective, private liberal ars college, found that The College visited the same schools year after year because successful recruiting depends on long-term relationships with high schools. Further, the College tended to visit affluent schools, and private schools in particular, because these schools enroll high-achieving students who can afford tuition and because these schools have the resources and motivation to host a successful visit.

Analyses of the effects of off-campus recruiting broadly conceive off-campus recruiting as a means of simultaneously identifying prospects and connecting with prospects already being targeted through mail/email [e.g., @RN4323; @RN4315; @RN3519]. @RN4402 found that off-campus visits were the second highest source of inquiries (after student list purchases), accounting for 19.0\% of inquiries for the median public university. Off-campus visits were also the third highest source of enrollees (after stealth applicants and on-campus visits), accounting for 16\% of enrollees \citep{RN4402}.  @RN4324, who analyzed recruiting from the perspective of high school students, found that high school visits influenced where students applied and where they enrolled, particularly first-generation students. By contrast, affluent students with college-educated parents tended to be less taken by overtures from universities and more concerned about university prestige. Finally, echoing findings from market research [@RN4402], @RN3519 found that high school visits were instrumental for maintaining strong relationships with guidance counselors at "feeder schools." These relationships were essential because "the College's reputation and the quality of its applicant pool are dependent upon its connections with high schools nationwide" [@RN3519, p. 53].

While prior research finds that off-campus recruiting influences the application and enrollment decisions of underrepresented students and accounts for a larger share of university marketing/recruiting budgets, our research is the first to systematically investigate which high schools receive visits by which universities.

## Policy Implications


Mainstream policy debates identify the "achievement gap," "under-matching" -- when high achieving students fail to apply to selective colleges -- and inability to pay as primary causes of racial and socioeconomic inequality in college access.  These explanations highlight the deficiences of students, households, and k-12 schools and -- using the language of economists -- can all be described as "demand side" factors. In turn, policy solutons focus on fixing students, emphasizing interventions that increase achievement and interventions that reduce under-match by giving students better information and guidance about college options.  If universities are biased against low-income students or communities of color, then fixing student achievement and student decision-making will not overcome access inequality. 

Our research suggests that policy debates about college access must be reframed to focus on university enrollment priorities. We use university recruiting behavior as an indicator of enrollment priorities. The majority of public research universities in our analysis sample made far more out-of-state recruiting visits than in-state recruiting visits.  Out of state recruiting visits were concentrated in affluent, predominantly white public and private schools.  This income and racial bias persisted even after controlling for school size and academic achievement.


Public funding for higher education dramatically affects university enrollment priorities. Cuts to public funding shift higher education from a public good to a private good, creating incentives to prioritize customers who pay the most. Nonresident tuition price is typically two to three times higher than resident price. Public research universities responded to state funding cuts following the 2008 recession by dramatically growing nonresident enrollment [CITE]. Many public flagship universities adopted institutional financial aid policies that explicitly target out-of-state students with mediocre academic achievement [CITE]. We found a strong relationship between state funding and recruiting behavior. Universities with weak state funding tended make the most out-of-state recruiting visits. Universities with strong state funding tended to visit a larger share of in-state high schools and were more likely to visit in-state schools with large shares of low-income students and non-white students. 


While state policymakers often rationalize cuts to public research universities based on the premise that these universities can generate alternative revenues, the fundamental takeaway from our research is that forcing universities to survive from tuition revenue compels universities to prioritize customers with high ability to pay.

Although policy debates about public funding and college access certainly consider prices and affordability, these issues are discussed in terms of their effects on student behavior rather than their effects on university behavior. We argue that higher education funding policies should be debated in terms of their effects on university enrollment behavior.  

Given their responsibility to prepare the future professional, business, and civic leaders of the state, higher education funding policy should encourage public research universities to enroll the most talented, meritorious students in the state rather those who generate the most revenue. 

We highlight two broad funding solutions to change university enrollment priorities: first, increase block grant funding such that universities can pay for the cost of educating students without relying on tuition; and, second, increase need-based financial aid as a means of increasing the purchasing power of poor students.

State appropriations are the most important source of block grant funding to universities. When state appropriations decline, universities ask permisson to increase resident tuition price. Granting this request reduces the number of state residents who can afford in-state public universities. Denying this request reduces the ability of public universities to survive by enrolling state residents and increases the incentive to enroll nonresident students.  By contrast, if state appropriations increased substantially, states could demand a reduction in resident tuition price and universities could survive by enrolling state residents.

Need-based grant aid programs can be thought of as voucher programs that follow students. These programs increase the purchasing power of poor students, making them more financially attractive to universities that rely on tuition revenue.  The most important programs are federal Pell Grant and state need-based grant aid (e.g., ).  Though not a grant, income sharing agreements (ISAs) represent a private sector approach to increasing student purchasing power [DEFINE ISAs? CITE?].  Policy changes that substantially increase the maximum award (e.g., increasing the Pell maximum from $6,195 to $10,000) enable universities to enroll low-income students without offering substantial need-based institutional aid, thereby increasing the number of low-income students they are willing to enroll.

Following decades of pessimism about public funding for higher education, many states are adopting "free college" policies and Presidential candidates have unveiled plans to dramatically increase federal investments. While most analyses focus on the effects of these programs and plans on student behavior, we comment briefly on the consequences for university behavior.

State "free college" policies -- often called "free tuition" policies are voucher programs that provide eligible students with grant aid to cover costs associated with attending in-state public institutions. These programs are designed to be combined with other sources of grant aid (e.g., Pell, state need- and merit-based aid).  Programs differ on several dimensions [@RN4467]: which costs can be covered (e.g., tuition, fees, living expenses); "first dollar" (i.e., receiving other grant aid does not reduce award amount) versus "last dollar" (award only covers eligible costs not covered by other grant aid); whether award can be used at public universities or only community colleges; etc.

COMMENTS ON FREE COLLEGE POLICIES
- GOOD THAT THEY ARE NOT AN UNFUNDED MANDATE [FORCING UNIVERSITIES TO ENROLL STUDENTS WITHOUT TUITION $ FOLLOWING STUDENTS]
- BEST THOUGHT OF AS STATE MERIT/NEED BASED AID
- THESE ARE VOUCHERS THAT INCREASE DESIRABILITY OF LOW-INCOME STUDENTS, BUT FUNDING AMOUNTS ARE GENERALLY MODEST, SO WON'T RESULT IN BIG CHANGES.




Public research universities prepare the future professional, business, and civic leaders of the state 

and their priority should be enrolling the most talented, meritorious students in the state.

Contemporary policy debates about racial and socioeconomic inequality in college access tend to focus on the “achievement gap” and on “undermatching,” the idea that high-achieving, low-income students fail to apply to good colleges because they have bad guidance at home and at school (The White House, 2014b). These explanations focus on “deficiencies” of students and K-12 schools. As such, policy interventions to increase college access mostly focus on student academic achievement and decision-making (Page & Scott-Clayton, 2016).
